### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This project is intended to deliver a Python script that can provide a user-friendly way to investigate large amounts of raw bikeshare data. 
The script itself should utilize a series of functions which request user input. Analyses are subsequently performed on the raw data based on these inputted values and answers are displayed in readable formats. The script must run without breaking due to any errors resulting from mis-formatted input.
